# Proposal for <Web Application>

	We aim to create a web application that allows users to share images/text on a forum-type website.
This project will include using C# , CSS, HTML, SQL and XML languages. We aim to divide user submissions
into categories that can be searched. Users will be allowed to follow categories for new submissions as 
well as create new categories. Submissions should be defaulted to be viewed by the public and have a 
setting to determine the privacy of the submission. All submissions will be onto a database to be used 
for searching and categorization.

## Main Features for <Web Application>:

     	The main website feature will be based around a forum web application; users can submit an image 
and/or text that is put into categories determined by the user and maintained by administrators. 
Categories will be determined based on subject of submission. Submissions can be a part of multiple 
categories, implemented in a similar way as apps such as Instagram or Tumblr. 

	The design for the website will be centered and default to a page that has the user profile, a 
main home base that users can look at posts that they track, implemented either by category or user. 
Other windows for the website will include a search window to be able to search for a category and/or a 
user. The first page that a user will encounter will be a sign-in/sign-up page that has a short 
description of the site and its features.

	To handle the submission of images, there will be a conversion of resolutions to create less 
clutter on the pages of our web application. For example, we do not want an image to be larger than the 
computer screen.

### Direction of Implementation of Project

	We aim to use Visual Studio to create our web page as it contains helpful features and templates 
in order to more easily create a website. This is where we are going to use C# in our project on top of 
an ASP.NET framework.
