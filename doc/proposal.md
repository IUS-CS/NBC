# Proposal 

We will create a game using PhaserIO and the libraries that are included with it.  
The Phaser project is created in JavaScript and all of it's libraries.  
Our game will also be in JavaScript.

## About the game

The game will be an infinite scrolling game where we have a character jump over
blocks that move towards him.  He will have 5 lives that he will have to lose 
before the game is over.  The world will be a black background and he will run 

### Implementation

Our implementation will be done on any text editor that we choose.  For us, 
we will use Sublime or Brackets to do our coding.
