# Design Patterns

*******
We cannot identify any patterns that we aready are using, but the design patters that we are going to implement in this project are factories, iterators and observers.

*******

__Factory uses__

	1. We are going to implement a factory to create each post and post it to the timeline.
	2. Factories could also be used for creating each new profile.

__Iterator uses__
	
	1. The iterator can be used for the friend's list to show the list of the user's friends, but will not show the posts of the friends. 

__Obserber uses_
	
	1. The observer will be used for profile pictures on each post, so when the profile picture is changed the picture on each post will change accordingly.
