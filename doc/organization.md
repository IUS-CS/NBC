# Organization

We will all be learning most of the aspects of Phaser that we will need to implement our game.
Brad will implement the character sprites and the animation.
Nick will implement the placement of the blocks and their movement towards the character.
Cody will implement the rest of the world and the lives counter and losing animation.
